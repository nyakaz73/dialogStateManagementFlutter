# dialogStateManagementFlutter - using Providers and ChangeNotifiers
Flutter State Management can be somehow difficult to understand for a beginner and somewhat tiresome to learn as you will have so many options to archive the same thing. In this project i am going to show you how you can easily manage your states using Providers and ChangeNotifiers in flutter. I will be using a pop-up Dialog(modal) to manage my states

Problem to be solved:
Say you want to have a simple customer registration page and inside this page you have a floating action button thats when pressed it pops up a modal / Dialog that allows you to capture fields like name, surname email address etc. Then when you press add button/ save on you Dialog you want your dialog to disapear and then update a listview on your page showing the registered customers.
